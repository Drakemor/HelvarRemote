# HelvarRemote
Control Helvar Light system on your Android phone with IR blaster

This project was created because we didn't had enough remotes to control lights in our open space.

How:
I have recorded IR codes emitted by original remote using arduino with IR receiver and implemented the same functionality in Android.
